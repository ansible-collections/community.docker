minor_changes:
- "docker_container - added ``default_host_ip`` option which allows to explicitly set the default IP string for published ports without explicitly specified IPs. When using IPv6 binds with Docker 20.10.2 or newer, this needs to be set to an empty string (``""``) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/70, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/71)."
