bugfixes:
  - "docker_compose_v2_pull - fixing idempotence by checking actual pull progress events instead of service-level pull request when ``policy=always``. This stops the module from reporting ``changed=true`` if no actual change happened when pulling. In check mode, it has to assume that a change happens though (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/813, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/814)."
