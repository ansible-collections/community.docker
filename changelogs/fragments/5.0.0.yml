removed_features:
  - The collection no longer supports ansible-core 2.15 and 2.16.
    You need ansible-core 2.17.0 or newer to use community.docker 5.x.y (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/1123).
  - The collection no longer supports Python 3.6 and before.
    Note that this coincides with the Python requirements of ansible-core 2.17+ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/1123).
