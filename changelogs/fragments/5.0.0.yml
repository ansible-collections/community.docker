release_summary: |-
  New major release.

  The main changes are that the collection dropped support for some ansible-core
  versions that are End of Life, and thus dropped support for Python 2.7.
  This allowed to modernize the Python code, in particular with type hints.
  Also all module and plugin utils are now private to the collection, which
  makes it easier to refactor code. All these changes should have no effect on
  end-users.
