minor_changes:
  - "The ``docker_stack*`` modules now use the common CLI-based module code added for the ``docker_image_build`` and ``docker_compose_v2`` modules. This means that the modules now have various more configuration options with respect to talking to the Docker Daemon, and now also are part of the ``community.docker.docker`` and ``docker`` module default groups (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/745)."
