deprecated_features:
- "docker_container - currently ``published_ports`` can contain port mappings next to the special value ``all``, in which case the port mappings are ignored. This behavior is deprecated for community.docker 2.0.0, at which point it will either be forbidden, or this behavior will be properly implemented similar to how the Docker CLI tool handles this (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/8, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/60)."
