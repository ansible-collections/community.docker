minor_changes:
  - "docker_compose_v2* modules - allow to provide an inline definition of the compose content
     instead of having to provide a ``project_src`` directory with the compose file written into it
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/829, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/832)."
  - "The EE requirements now include PyYAML, since the ``docker_compose_v2*`` modules depend on it
     when the ``definition`` option is used. This should not have a noticable effect on generated EEs
     since ansible-core itself depends on PyYAML as well
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/832)."
