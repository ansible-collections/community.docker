minor_changes:
  - "docker_compose_v2* modules - allow to provide an inline definition of the compose content
     instead of having to provide a ``project_src`` directory with the compose file written into it
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/829, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/832)."
