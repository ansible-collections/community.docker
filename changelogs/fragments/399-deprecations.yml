removed_features:
  - "docker_container - the default of ``command_handling`` was changed from ``compatibility`` to ``correct``. Older versions were warning for every invocation of the module when this would result in a change of behavior (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/399)."
  - "docker_container - the ``all`` value is no longer allowed in ``published_ports``. Use ``publish_all_ports=true`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/399)."
