minor_changes:
- "docker_container - allow ``memory_swap: -1`` to set memory swap limit to unlimited. This is useful when the user cannot set memory swap limits due to cgroup limitations or other reasons, as by default Docker will try to set swap usage to two times the value of ``memory`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/138)."
