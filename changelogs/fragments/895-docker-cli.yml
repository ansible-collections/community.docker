bugfixes:
  - "docker_compose_v2*, docker_stack*, docker_image_build modules - using ``cli_context`` no longer leads to an invalid parameter combination being passed to the corresponding Docker CLI tool, unless ``docker_host`` is also provided. Combining ``cli_context`` and ``docker_host`` is no longer allowed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/892, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/895)."
