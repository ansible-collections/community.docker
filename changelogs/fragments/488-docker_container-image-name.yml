minor_changes:
  - "docker_container - added ``image_name_mismatch`` option which allows to control the behavior if the container uses the image specified, but the container's configuration uses a different name for the image than the one provided to the module (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/485, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/488)."
