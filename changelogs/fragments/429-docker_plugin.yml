major_changes:
  - docker_plugin - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python. It requires ``requests`` to be installed,
    and depending on the features used has some more requirements. If the Docker SDK for Python is installed,
    these requirements are likely met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/429).
