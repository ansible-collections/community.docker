release_summary: |
  Bugfix and feature release.

  The collection now includes a bunch of new ``docker_image_*`` modules that move features out of the
  rather complex ``docker_image`` module. These new modules are easier to use and can better declare whether
  they support check mode, diff mode, or none of them.

  This version also features modules that support the Docker CLI plugins ``buildx`` and ``compose``.
  The ``docker_image_build`` module uses the ``docker buildx`` command under the hood, and the ``docker_compose_v2``
  and ``docker_compose_v2_pull`` modules uses the ``docker compose`` command. All these modules use the Docker CLI
  instead of directly talking to the API. The modules support mostly the same interface as the API based modules,
  so the main difference is that instead of some Python requirements, they depend on the Docker CLI tool ``docker``.
