deprecated_features:
- Support for Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10 is deprecated, and will be removed in the next major release (community.docker 3.0.0). Some modules might still work with these versions afterwards, but we will no longer keep compatibility code that was needed to support them (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/361).
