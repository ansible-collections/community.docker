bugfixes:
  - "docker connection plugin - make sure that ``docker_extra_args`` is used for querying the Docker version.
     Also ensures that the Docker version is only queried when needed. This is currently the case if a remote user is specified
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/325, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/327)."
