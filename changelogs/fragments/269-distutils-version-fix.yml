bugfixes:
  - "Fix unintended breaking change caused by `an earlier fix <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/258>`_ by vendoring the deprecated Python standard library ``distutils.version`` until this collection stops supporting Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/267, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/269)."
