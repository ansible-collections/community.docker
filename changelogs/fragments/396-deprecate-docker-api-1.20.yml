deprecated_features:
  - "Support for Docker API version 1.20 has been deprecated and will be removed in community.docker 3.0.0.
     Support for it was dropped from Docker SDK for Python already in 2018 for version 3.0.0. This affects
     the modules ``docker_container``, ``docker_container_exec``, ``docker_container_info``, ``docker_compose``,
     ``docker_login``, ``docker_image``, and ``docker_image_info``, whose minimally supported API version
     is 1.20 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/396)."
