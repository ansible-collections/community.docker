deprecated_features:
  - "docker_container - the ``ignore_image`` option is deprecated and will be removed in community.docker 4.0.0. Use ``image: ignore`` in ``comparisons`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/487)."
  - "docker_container - the ``purge_networks`` option is deprecated and will be removed in community.docker 4.0.0. Use ``networks: strict`` in ``comparisons`` instead, and make sure to provide ``networks``, with value ``[]`` if all networks should be removed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/487)."
