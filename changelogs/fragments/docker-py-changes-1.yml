  - "modules and plugins communicating directly with the Docker daemon - fix parsing of IPv6 addresses with a port in ``docker_host``. This is only a change relatively to older community.docker 3.0.0 pre-releases, or with respect to Docker SDK for Python < 6.0.0. Docker SDK for Python 6.0.0 also includes this bugfix (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/434)."
  - "modules and plugins communicating directly with the Docker daemon - fix ``ProxyCommand`` handling for SSH connections when not using ``use_ssh_client=true``. This is only a change relatively to older community.docker 3.0.0 pre-releases, or with respect to Docker SDK for Python < 6.0.0. Docker SDK for Python 6.0.0 also includes this change (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/434)."
  - "modules and plugins communicating directly with the Docker daemon - do not create a subshell for SSH connections when using ``use_ssh_client=true``. This is only a change relatively to older community.docker 3.0.0 pre-releases, or with respect to Docker SDK for Python < 6.0.0. Docker SDK for Python 6.0.0 also includes this change (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/434)."
minor_changes:
  - "modules and plugins communicating directly with the Docker daemon - improve default TLS version selection for Python 3.6 and newer. This is only a change relatively to older community.docker 3.0.0 pre-releases, or with respect to Docker SDK for Python < 6.0.0. Docker SDK for Python 6.0.0 also includes this bugfix (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/434)."
security_fixes:
  - "modules and plugins communicating directly with the Docker daemon - when connecting by SSH and not using ``use_ssh_client=true``, reject unknown host keys instead of accepting them. This is only a breaking change relatively to older community.docker 3.0.0 pre-releases, or with respect to Docker SDK for Python < 6.0.0. Docker SDK for Python 6.0.0 also includes this change (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/434)."
