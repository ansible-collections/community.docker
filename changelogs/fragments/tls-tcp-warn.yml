  - "docker_container_exec - does **not work with TCP TLS sockets** when the ``stdin`` option is used! This is caused by the inability
     to send an ``close_notify`` TLS alert without closing the connection with Python's ``SSLSocket``
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/605, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/621)."
  - "docker_api connection plugin - does **not work with TCP TLS sockets**! This is caused by the inability to send an ``close_notify``
