bugfixes:
  - "docker_container - fix ``pull`` idempotency with Docker 29.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/1192)."
  - "docker_container - fix idempotency for IPv6 addresses with Docker 29.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/1192)."
  - "docker_container - fix handling of exposed port ranges. So far, the module used an undocumented feature of Docker that was removed from Docker 29.0.0,
     that allowed to pass the range to the deamon and let handle it. Now the module explodes ranges into a list of all contained ports, same as the
     Docker CLI does. For backwards compatibility with Docker < 29.0.0, it also explodes ranges returned by the API for existing containers so that
     comparison should only indicate a difference if the ranges actually change (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/1192)."
