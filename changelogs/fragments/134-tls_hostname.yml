deprecated_features:
- "docker_* modules and plugins, except ``docker_swarm`` connection plugin and ``docker_compose`` and ``docker_stack*` modules - the current default ``localhost`` for ``tls_hostname`` is deprecated. In community.docker 2.0.0 it will be computed from ``docker_host`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/134)."
