bugfixes:
  - "docker_container - when ``detach=false``, wait indefinitely and not at most one minute. This was the behavior with Docker SDK for Python, and was accidentally changed in 3.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/526, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/527)."
