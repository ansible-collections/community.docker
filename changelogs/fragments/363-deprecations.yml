removed_features:
  - "docker_stack - the return values ``out`` and ``err`` have been removed. Use ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/363)."
  - "Various modules - the default of ``tls_hostname`` (``localhost``) has been removed. If you want to continue using ``localhost``, you need to specify it explicitly (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/363)."
