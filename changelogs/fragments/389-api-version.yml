bugfixes:
  - "Docker SDK for Python based modules and plugins - if the API version is specified as an option, use that one to validate API version requirements of module/plugin options instead of the latest API version supported by the Docker daemon. This also avoids one unnecessary API call per module/plugin (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/389)."
