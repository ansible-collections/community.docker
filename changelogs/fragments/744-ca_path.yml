minor_changes:
  - "The ``ca_cert`` option available to almost all modules and plugins has been renamed to ``ca_path``. The name ``ca_path`` is also used for similar options in ansible-core and other collections. The old name has been added as an alias and can still be used (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/744)."
