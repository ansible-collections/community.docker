bugfixes:
  - "docker_container_exec - ``chdir`` is only supported since Docker SDK for Python 3.0.0. Make sure that this option can only use when 3.0.0 or later is installed, and prevent passing this parameter on when ``chdir`` is not provided to this module (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/243, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/242)."
  - "docker_api connection plugin - avoid passing an unnecessary argument to a Docker SDK for Python call that is only supported by version 3.0.0 or later (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/243)."
