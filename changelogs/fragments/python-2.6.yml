deprecated_features:
  - "Support for Python 2.6 is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release (community.docker 3.0.0).
     Some modules might still work with Python 2.6, but we will no longer try to ensure compatibility
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/388)."
