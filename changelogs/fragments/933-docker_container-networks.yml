minor_changes:
  - "docker_container - when creating a container, directly pass all networks to connect to to the Docker Daemon
     for API version 1.44 and newer. This makes creation more efficient and works around a bug in Docker Daemon that
     does not use the specified MAC address in at least some cases, though only for creation
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/933)."
bugfixes:
  - "docker_container - restore behavior of the module from community.docker 2.x.y that passes the first network
     to the Docker Deamon while creating the container (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/933)."
known_issues:
  - "docker_container - when specifying a MAC address for a container's network, and the network is attached
     after container creation (for example, due to idempotency checks), the MAC address is at least in some
     cases ignored by the Docker Daemon (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/933)."
