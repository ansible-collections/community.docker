minor_changes:
  - "docker_container - when creating a network, directly pass the networks to connect to to the Docker Daemon.
     This makes creation more efficient and works around a bug in Docker Daemon that does not use the specified
     MAC address in at least some cases, though only for creation (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/933)."
known_issues:
  - "docker_container - when specifying a MAC address for a container's network, and the network is attached
     after container creation (for example, due to idempotency checks), the MAC address is at least in some
     cases ignored by the Docker Daemon (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/933)."
