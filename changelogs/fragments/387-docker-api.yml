major_changes:
  - "The collection now contains vendored code from the Docker SDK for Python to talk to the Docker daemon.
     Modules and plugins using this code no longer need the Docker SDK for Python installed on the machine
     the module resp. plugin is running on
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/387)."
  - "docker_host_info - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python. It requires ``requests`` to be installed,
     and depending on the features used has some more requirements. If the Docker SDK for Python is installed,
     these requirements are likely met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/387)."
