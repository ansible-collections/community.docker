major_changes:
  - "The ``community.docker`` collection now depends on the ``community.library_inventory_filtering_v1`` collection.
     This utility collection provides host filtering functionality for inventory plugins.
     If you use the Ansible community package, both collections are included and you do not have to do anything special.
     If you install the collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install``, it will be installed automatically.
     If you install the collection by copying the files of the collection to a place where ansible-core can find it,
     for example by cloning the git repository, you need to make sure that you also have to install the dependency
     if you are using the inventory plugins
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/698)."
minor_changes:
  - "inventory plugins - add ``filter`` option which allows to include and exclude hosts based on Jinja2 conditions (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/698, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/610)."
