minor_changes:
  - "docker_container - added new ``command_handling`` option with current deprecated default value ``compatibility`` which allows to control how the module handles shell quoting when interpreting lists, and how the module handles empty lists/strings. The default will switch to ``correct`` in community.docker 3.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/186)."
deprecated_features:
  - "docker_container - the new ``command_handling``'s default value, ``compatibility``, is deprecated and will change to ``correct`` in community.docker 3.0.0. A deprecation warning is emitted by the module in cases where the behavior will change. Please note that ansible-core will output a deprecation warning only once, so if it is shown for an earlier task, there could be more tasks with this warning where it is not shown (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/186)."
