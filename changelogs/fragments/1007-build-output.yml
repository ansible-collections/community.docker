known_issues:
  - "docker_image_build - when ``outputs`` is specified, all entries with ``type=image``, ``type=oci`` and ``type=docker`` have their
     name overwritten by the values provided in ``name`` and ``tag``. This happens because the module provides the ``--tag`` option
     with the values of the ``name`` and ``tag`` options to Docker the buildx plugin, which for some reason takes that value and
     uses it to overwrite the values in ``--output`` parameters
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/1001, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/1007)."
