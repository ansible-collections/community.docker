major_changes:
  - "docker_image_info - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python. It requires ``requests`` to be installed,
     and depending on the features used has some more requirements. If the Docker SDK for Python is installed,
     these requirements are likely met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/405)."
