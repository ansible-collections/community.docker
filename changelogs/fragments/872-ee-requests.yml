bugfixes:
  - "EE requirements - restrict ``requests`` dependency to ``< 2.32.0`` since later versions are incompatible with
     Docker SDK for Python < 7.1.0, which we depend on (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/872)."
known_issues:
  - "EE requirements - ``requests < 2.32.0`` is vulnerable to `CVE-2024-35195 <https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56>`__.
     This does not affect Docker SDK for Python, but might affect other users of ``requests``
     (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/872)."
