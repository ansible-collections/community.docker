minor_changes:
  - docker_image - when using ``archive_path``, detect whether changes are necessary based on the image ID (hash). If the existing tar archive matches the source, do nothing.
    Previously, each task execution re-created the archive
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/500).
