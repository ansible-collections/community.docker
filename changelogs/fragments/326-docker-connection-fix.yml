bugfixes:
  - "docker connection plugin - also use ``docker_extra_args`` during Docker version check. This was accidentally removed by a bugfix in the previous release (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/325, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/326)."
