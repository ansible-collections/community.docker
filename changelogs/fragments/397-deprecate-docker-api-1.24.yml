deprecated_features:
  - "Support for Docker API version 1.20 to 1.24 has been deprecated and will be removed in community.docker 3.0.0.
     The first Docker version supporting API version 1.25 was Docker 1.13, released in January 2017.
     This affects the modules ``docker_container``, ``docker_container_exec``, ``docker_container_info``, ``docker_compose``,
     ``docker_login``, ``docker_image``, ``docker_image_info``, ``docker_image_load``, ``docker_host_info``, ``docker_network``,
     ``docker_network_info``, ``docker_node_info``, ``docker_swarm_info``, ``docker_swarm_service``, ``docker_swarm_service_info``,
     ``docker_volume_info``, and ``docker_volume``, whose minimally supported API version
     is between 1.20 and 1.24 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/396)."
