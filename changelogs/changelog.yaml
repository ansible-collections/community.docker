    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - docker_container - the validation for ``capabilities`` in ``device_requests``
        was incorrect (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/42,

  1.1.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
      - docker_image - if ``push=true`` is used with ``repository``, and the image
        does not need to be tagged, still push. This can happen if ``repository``
        and ``name`` are equal (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/52,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/53).
      - docker_image - report error when loading a broken archive that contains no
        image (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/46,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/55).
      - docker_image - report error when the loaded archive does not contain the specified
        image (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/41,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/55).
      deprecated_features:
      - docker_container - currently ``published_ports`` can contain port mappings
        next to the special value ``all``, in which case the port mappings are ignored.
        This behavior is deprecated for community.docker 2.0.0, at which point it
        will either be forbidden, or this behavior will be properly implemented similar
        to how the Docker CLI tool handles this (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/8,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/60).
      minor_changes:
      - docker_container - support specifying ``cgroup_parent`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/6,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/59).
      - docker_container - when a container is started with ``detached=false``, ``status``
        is now also returned when it is 0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/26,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/58).
      - docker_image - support ``platform`` when building images (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/22,
        https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/54).
