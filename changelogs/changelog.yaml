  1.0.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - docker_container - the validation for ``capabilities`` in ``device_requests``
          was incorrect (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/42,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/43).

  1.1.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - docker_image - if ``push=true`` is used with ``repository``, and the image
          does not need to be tagged, still push. This can happen if ``repository``
          and ``name`` are equal (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/52,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/53).
        - docker_image - report error when loading a broken archive that contains
          no image (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/46,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/55).
        - docker_image - report error when the loaded archive does not contain the
          specified image (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/41,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/55).
      deprecated_features:
        - docker_container - currently ``published_ports`` can contain port mappings
          next to the special value ``all``, in which case the port mappings are ignored.
          This behavior is deprecated for community.docker 2.0.0, at which point it
          will either be forbidden, or this behavior will be properly implemented
          similar to how the Docker CLI tool handles this (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/8,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/60).
      minor_changes:
        - docker_container - support specifying ``cgroup_parent`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/6,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/59).
        - docker_container - when a container is started with ``detached=false``,
          ``status`` is now also returned when it is 0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/26,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/58).
        - docker_image - support ``platform`` when building images (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/22,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/54).

  1.2.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - docker_container - allow IPv6 zones (RFC 4007) in bind IPs (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/66).
        - docker_image - fix crash on loading images with versions of Docker SDK for
          Python before 2.5.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/72,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/73).
      minor_changes:
        - docker_container - added ``default_host_ip`` option which allows to explicitly
          set the default IP string for published ports without explicitly specified
          IPs. When using IPv6 binds with Docker 20.10.2 or newer, this needs to be
          set to an empty string (``""``) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/70,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/71).

  1.2.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - docker connection plugin - fix Docker version parsing, as some docker versions
          have a leading ``v`` in the output of the command ``docker version --format
          "{{.Server.Version}}"`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/76).

    changes:
      release_summary: Security bugfix release to address CVE-2021-20191.
      security_fixes:
        - docker_swarm - enabled ``no_log`` for the option ``signing_ca_key`` to prevent
          accidental disclosure (CVE-2021-20191, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/80).

  1.3.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - docker_container - fix healthcheck disabling idempotency issue with strict
          comparison (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/85).
        - docker_image - prevent module failure when removing image that is removed
          between inspection and removal (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/87).
        - docker_image - prevent module failure when removing non-existent image by
          ID (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/87).
        - docker_image_info - prevent module failure when image vanishes between listing
          and inspection (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/87).
        - docker_image_info - prevent module failure when querying non-existent image
          by ID (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/87).
      minor_changes:
        - docker_container - add ``storage_opts`` option to specify storage options
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/91, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/93).
        - docker_image - allows to specify platform to pull for ``source=pull`` with
          new option ``pull_platform`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/79,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/89).
        - docker_image - properly support image IDs (hashes) for loading and tagging
          images (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/86,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/87).
        - docker_swarm_service - adding support for maximum number of tasks per node
          (``replicas_max_per_node``) when running swarm service in replicated mode.
          Introduced in API 1.40 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/7,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/92).

    release_date: '2021-03-08'
  1.4.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - docker_swarm - if ``join_token`` is specified, a returned join token with
          the same value will be replaced by ``VALUE_SPECIFIED_IN_NO_LOG_PARAMETER``.
          Make sure that you do not blindly use the join tokens from the return value
          of this module when the module is invoked with ``join_token`` specified!
          This breaking change appears in a minor release since it is necessary to
          fix a security issue (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/103).
      bugfixes:
        - '``docker_swarm_service`` - fix KeyError on caused by reference to deprecated
          option ``update_failure_action`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/100).'
        - docker_swarm_service - mark ``secrets`` module option with ``no_log=False``
          since it does not leak secrets (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/2001).
      minor_changes:
        - docker_swarm_service - change ``publish.published_port`` option from mandatory
          to optional. Docker will assign random high port if not specified (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/99).
      release_summary: Security release to address another potential secret leak.
        Also includes regular bugfixes and features.
      security_fixes:
        - docker_swarm - the ``join_token`` option is now marked as ``no_log`` so
          it is no longer written into logs (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/103).

  1.5.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - all modules - use ``to_native`` to convert exceptions to strings (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/121).
      minor_changes:
        - Add the ``use_ssh_client`` option to most docker modules and plugins (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/108,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/114).

  1.6.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - 'docker-compose - fix not pulling when ``state: present`` and ``stopped:
          true`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/12,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/119).'
        - docker_plugin - also configure plugin after installing (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/118,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/135).
        - docker_swarm_services - avoid crash during idempotence check if ``published_port``
          is not specified (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/107,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/136).
      deprecated_features:
        - docker_* modules and plugins, except ``docker_swarm`` connection plugin
          and ``docker_compose`` and ``docker_stack*` modules - the current default
          ``localhost`` for ``tls_hostname`` is deprecated. In community.docker 2.0.0
          it will be computed from ``docker_host`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/134).
      minor_changes:
        - common module utils - correct error messages for guiding to install proper
          Docker SDK for Python module (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/125).
        - 'docker_container - allow ``memory_swap: -1`` to set memory swap limit to
          unlimited. This is useful when the user cannot set memory swap limits due
          to cgroup limitations or other reasons, as by default Docker will try to
          set swap usage to two times the value of ``memory`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/138).'

      bugfixes:
        - docker_* modules and plugins, except ``docker_swarm`` connection plugin
          and ``docker_compose`` and ``docker_stack*` modules - only emit ``tls_hostname``
          deprecation message if TLS is actually used (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/143).

        - 'docker_compose - fix idempotence bug when using ``stopped: true`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/142,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/159).'
      minor_changes:
        - Avoid internal ansible-core module_utils in favor of equivalent public API
          available since at least Ansible 2.9 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/164).
        - docker_compose - added ``profiles`` option to specify service profiles when
          starting services (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/167).
        - docker_containers inventory plugin - when ``connection_type=docker-api``,
          now pass Docker daemon connection options from inventory plugin to connection
          plugin. This can be disabled by setting ``configure_docker_daemon=false``
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/157).
        - docker_host_info - allow values for keys in ``containers_filters``, ``images_filters``,
          ``networks_filters``, and ``volumes_filters`` to be passed as YAML lists
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/160).
        - docker_plugin - added ``alias`` option to specify local names for docker
          plugins (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/161).

  1.9.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - docker_compose - fixes task failures when bringing up services while using
          ``docker-compose <1.17.0`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/180).
        - docker_container - make sure to also return ``container`` on ``detached=false``
          when status code is non-zero (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/178).
        - docker_stack_info - make sure that module isn't skipped in check mode (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/183).
        - docker_stack_task_info - make sure that module isn't skipped in check mode
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/183).
      deprecated_features:
        - docker_container - the new ``command_handling``'s default value, ``compatibility``,
          is deprecated and will change to ``correct`` in community.docker 3.0.0.
          A deprecation warning is emitted by the module in cases where the behavior
          will change. Please note that ansible-core will output a deprecation warning
          only once, so if it is shown for an earlier task, there could be more tasks
          with this warning where it is not shown (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/186).
      minor_changes:
        - docker_* modules - include ``ImportError`` traceback when reporting that
          Docker SDK for Python could not be found (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/188).
        - docker_compose - added ``env_file`` option for specifying custom environment
          files (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/174).
        - docker_container - added ``publish_all_ports`` option to publish all exposed
          ports to random ports except those explicitly bound with ``published_ports``
          (this was already added in community.docker 1.8.0) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/162).
        - docker_container - added new ``command_handling`` option with current deprecated
          default value ``compatibility`` which allows to control how the module handles
          shell quoting when interpreting lists, and how the module handles empty
          lists/strings. The default will switch to ``correct`` in community.docker
          3.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/186).
        - docker_container - lifted restriction preventing the creation of anonymous
          volumes with the ``mounts`` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/181).

  2.0.0:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - docker_compose - fixed ``timeout`` defaulting behavior so that ``stop_grace_period``,
          if defined in the compose file, will be used if ``timeout`` is not specified
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/163).
      deprecated_features:
        - docker_container - using the special value ``all`` in ``published_ports``
          has been deprecated. Use ``publish_all_ports=true`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/210).
      release_summary: New major release with some deprecations removed and a breaking
        change in the ``docker_compose`` module regarding the ``timeout`` parameter.
      removed_features:
        - docker_container - the default value of ``container_default_behavior`` changed
          to ``no_defaults`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/210).
        - docker_container - the default value of ``network_mode`` is now the name
          of the first network specified in ``networks`` if such are specified and
          ``networks_cli_compatible=true`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/210).
        - docker_container - the special value ``all`` can no longer be used in ``published_ports``
          next to other values. Please use ``publish_all_ports=true`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/210).
        - docker_login - removed the ``email`` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/210).

  2.0.2:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - docker_api connection plugin - avoid passing an unnecessary argument to
          a Docker SDK for Python call that is only supported by version 3.0.0 or
          later (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/243).
        - docker_container_exec - ``chdir`` is only supported since Docker SDK for
          Python 3.0.0. Make sure that this option can only use when 3.0.0 or later
          is installed, and prevent passing this parameter on when ``chdir`` is not
          provided to this module (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/243,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/242).
        - nsenter connection plugin - ensure the ``nsenter_pid`` option is retrieved
          in ``_connect`` instead of ``__init__`` to prevent a crash due to bad initialization
          order (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/249).
        - nsenter connection plugin - replace the use of ``--all-namespaces`` with
          specific namespaces to support compatibility with Busybox nsenter (used
          on, for example, Alpine containers) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/249).

  2.1.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Various modules and plugins - use vendored version of ``distutils.version``
          included in ansible-core 2.12 if available. This avoids breakage when ``distutils``
          is removed from the standard library of Python 3.12. Note that ansible-core
          2.11, ansible-base 2.10 and Ansible 2.9 are right now not compatible with
          Python 3.12, hence this fix does not target these ansible-core/-base/2.9
          versions (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/258).
        - docker connection plugin - replace deprecated ``distutils.spawn.find_executable``
          with Ansible's ``get_bin_path`` to find the ``docker`` executable (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/257).
        - docker_container_exec - disallow using the ``chdir`` option for Docker API
          before 1.35 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/253).
      minor_changes:
        - docker_container_exec - add ``detach`` parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/250,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/255).
        - docker_container_exec - add ``env`` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/248,

          by vendoring the deprecated Python standard library ``distutils.version``
          until this collection stops supporting Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10

          are used (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/292).
      minor_changes:
        - docker_config - add support for rolling update, set ``rolling_versions``
          to ``true`` to enable (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/295,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/109).

          and ``cap_drop`` parameters. Usage is the same as with the ``capabilities``
          and ``cap_drop`` parameters for ``docker_container`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/294).

          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/307).
        - docker_api connection plugin - fix option handling to be compatible with
          ansible-core 2.13 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/308).
      minor_changes:

        - docker connection plugin - simplify ``actual_user`` handling code (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/311).
        - docker connection plugin - the plugin supports new ways to define the timeout.
          These are the ``ANSIBLE_DOCKER_TIMEOUT`` environment variable, the ``timeout``
          setting in the ``docker_connection`` section of ``ansible.cfg``, and the
          ``ansible_docker_timeout`` variable (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/297).

      bugfixes:
        - docker connection plugin - make sure that ``docker_extra_args`` is used
          for querying the Docker version. Also ensures that the Docker version is
          only queried when needed. This is currently the case if a remote user is
          specified (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/325,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/327).
      minor_changes:

          its dependencies. The ``docker_stack*`` modules are not supported (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/336).
        - current_container_facts - add detection for GitHub Actions (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/336).
        - docker_container - support returning Docker container log output when using
          Docker's ``local`` logging driver, an optimized local logging driver introduced

    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - docker_container - fail with a meaningful message instead of crashing if
          a port is specified with more than three colon-separated parts (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/367,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/365).
        - docker_container - remove unused code that will cause problems with Python
          3.13 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/354).
      deprecated_features:
        - Support for Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10 is deprecated, and will be
          removed in the next major release (community.docker 3.0.0). Some modules
          might still work with these versions afterwards, but we will no longer keep
          compatibility code that was needed to support them (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/361).
        - The dependency on docker-compose for Execution Environments is deprecated
          and will be removed in community.docker 3.0.0. The `Python docker-compose
          library <https://pypi.org/project/docker-compose/>`__ is unmaintained and
          can cause dependency issues. You can manually still install it in an Execution
          Environment when needed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/373).
        - Various modules - the default of ``tls_hostname`` that was supposed to be
          removed in community.docker 2.0.0 will now be removed in version 3.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/362).
        - docker_stack - the return values ``out`` and ``err`` that were supposed
          to be removed in community.docker 2.0.0 will now be removed in version 3.0.0
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/362).
      minor_changes:
        - docker_container - added ``image_label_mismatch`` parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/314,

  2.7.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - Docker SDK for Python based modules and plugins - if the API version is
          specified as an option, use that one to validate API version requirements
          of module/plugin options instead of the latest API version supported by
          the Docker daemon. This also avoids one unnecessary API call per module/plugin
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/389).
      deprecated_features:
        - Support for Docker API version 1.20 to 1.24 has been deprecated and will
          be removed in community.docker 3.0.0. The first Docker version supporting
          API version 1.25 was Docker 1.13, released in January 2017. This affects
          the modules ``docker_container``, ``docker_container_exec``, ``docker_container_info``,
          ``docker_compose``, ``docker_login``, ``docker_image``, ``docker_image_info``,
          ``docker_image_load``, ``docker_host_info``, ``docker_network``, ``docker_network_info``,
          ``docker_node_info``, ``docker_swarm_info``, ``docker_swarm_service``, ``docker_swarm_service_info``,
          ``docker_volume_info``, and ``docker_volume``, whose minimally supported
          API version is between 1.20 and 1.24 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/396).
        - Support for Python 2.6 is deprecated and will be removed in the next major
          release (community.docker 3.0.0). Some modules might still work with Python
          2.6, but we will no longer try to ensure compatibility (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/388).
      minor_changes:
        - Move common utility functions from the ``common`` module_util to a new module_util
          called ``util``. This should not have any user-visible effect (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/390).

      breaking_changes:
        - This collection does not work with ansible-core 2.11 on Python 3.12+. Please
          either upgrade to ansible-core 2.12+, or use Python 3.11 or earlier (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/271).
      major_changes:
        - The collection now contains vendored code from the Docker SDK for Python
          to talk to the Docker daemon. Modules and plugins using this code no longer
          need the Docker SDK for Python installed on the machine the module or plugin
          is running on (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/398).
        - docker_api connection plugin - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python.
          It requires ``requests`` to be installed, and depending on the features
          used has some more requirements. If the Docker SDK for Python is installed,
          these requirements are likely met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/414).
        - docker_container_exec - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python. It requires
          ``requests`` to be installed, and depending on the features used has some
          more requirements. If the Docker SDK for Python is installed, these requirements
          are likely met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/401).
        - docker_container_info - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python. It requires
          ``requests`` to be installed, and depending on the features used has some
          more requirements. If the Docker SDK for Python is installed, these requirements
          are likely met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/402).
        - docker_containers inventory plugin - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python.
          It requires ``requests`` to be installed, and depending on the features
          used has some more requirements. If the Docker SDK for Python is installed,
          these requirements are likely met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/413).
        - docker_host_info - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python. It requires
          ``requests`` to be installed, and depending on the features used has some
          more requirements. If the Docker SDK for Python is installed, these requirements
          are likely met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/403).
        - docker_image - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python. It requires ``requests``
          to be installed, and depending on the features used has some more requirements.
          If the Docker SDK for Python is installed, these requirements are likely
          met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/404).
        - docker_image_info - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python. It requires
          ``requests`` to be installed, and depending on the features used has some
          more requirements. If the Docker SDK for Python is installed, these requirements
          are likely met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/405).
        - docker_image_load - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python. It requires
          ``requests`` to be installed, and depending on the features used has some
          more requirements. If the Docker SDK for Python is installed, these requirements
          are likely met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/406).
        - docker_login - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python. It requires ``requests``
          to be installed, and depending on the features used has some more requirements.
          If the Docker SDK for Python is installed, these requirements are likely
          met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/407).
        - docker_network - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python. It requires ``requests``
          to be installed, and depending on the features used has some more requirements.
          If the Docker SDK for Python is installed, these requirements are likely
          met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/408).
        - docker_network_info - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python. It requires
          ``requests`` to be installed, and depending on the features used has some
          more requirements. If the Docker SDK for Python is installed, these requirements
          are likely met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/409).
        - docker_prune - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python. It requires ``requests``
          to be installed, and depending on the features used has some more requirements.
          If the Docker SDK for Python is installed, these requirements are likely
          met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/410).
        - docker_volume - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python. It requires ``requests``
          to be installed, and depending on the features used has some more requirements.
          If the Docker SDK for Python is installed, these requirements are likely
          met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/411).
        - docker_volume_info - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python. It requires
          ``requests`` to be installed, and depending on the features used has some

          are likely met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/412).
      minor_changes:
        - Remove vendored copy of ``distutils.version`` in favor of vendored copy
          included with ansible-core 2.12+. For ansible-core 2.11, uses ``distutils.version``
          for Python < 3.12. There is no support for ansible-core 2.11 with Python
          3.12+ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/271).
        - socker_handler and socket_helper module utils - improve Python forward compatibility,
          create helper functions for file blocking/unblocking (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/415).
      release_summary: First alpha prerelease of community.docker 3.0.0. This version
        has several breaking changes and features rewrites of several modules to directly
        use the API using ``requests``, instead of using the Docker SDK for Python.
      removed_features:
        - Execution Environments built with community.docker no longer include docker-compose
          < 2.0.0. If you need to use it with the ``docker_compose`` module, please
          install that requirement manually (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/400).
        - Support for Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10 has been removed. If you need
          support for Ansible 2.9 or ansible-base 2.10, please use community.docker
          2.x.y (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/400).
        - Support for Docker API versions 1.20 to 1.24 has been removed. If you need
          support for these API versions, please use community.docker 2.x.y (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/400).
        - Support for Python 2.6 has been removed. If you need support for Python
          2.6, please use community.docker 2.x.y (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/400).
        - Various modules - the default of ``tls_hostname`` (``localhost``) has been
          removed. If you want to continue using ``localhost``, you need to specify
          it explicitly (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/363).
        - docker_container - the ``all`` value is no longer allowed in ``published_ports``.
          Use ``publish_all_ports=true`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/399).
        - docker_container - the default of ``command_handling`` was changed from
          ``compatibility`` to ``correct``. Older versions were warning for every
          invocation of the module when this would result in a change of behavior
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/399).
        - docker_stack - the return values ``out`` and ``err`` have been removed.
          Use ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/363).

  3.0.0-a2:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
        - docker_container - ``exposed_ports`` is no longer ignored in ``comparisons``.
          Before, its value was assumed to be identical with the value of ``published_ports``
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/422).
        - docker_container - ``log_options`` can no longer be specified when ``log_driver``
          is not specified (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/422).
        - docker_container - ``publish_all_ports`` is no longer ignored in ``comparisons``
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/422).
        - docker_container - ``restart_retries`` can no longer be specified when ``restart_policy``
          is not specified (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/422).
        - docker_container - ``stop_timeout`` is no longer ignored for idempotency
          if told to be not ignored in ``comparisons``. So far it defaulted to ``ignore``
          there, and setting it to ``strict`` had no effect (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/422).
      major_changes:
        - docker_container - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python. It requires
          ``requests`` to be installed, and depending on the features used has some
          more requirements. If the Docker SDK for Python is installed, these requirements
          are likely met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/422).
        - docker_container - the module was completely rewritten from scratch (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/422).
        - docker_plugin - no longer uses the Docker SDK for Python. It requires ``requests``
          to be installed, and depending on the features used has some more requirements.
          If the Docker SDK for Python is installed, these requirements are likely
          met (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/429).
      minor_changes:
        - docker_container - add a new parameter ``image_comparison`` to control the
          behavior for which image will be used for idempotency checks (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/421,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/428).
        - docker_container - add support for ``cgroupns_mode`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/338,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/427).
        - docker_container - allow to specify ``platform`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/123,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/426).
      release_summary: 'Second alpha prerelease of community.docker 3.0.0. This version

        and features rewrites of several modules to directly use the API using ``requests``,
        instead of using

        the Docker SDK for Python.


        The largest change to the previous 3.0.0-a1 prerelease is that ``docker_container``
        module has been

        rewritten. It now also no longer needs the Docker SDK for Python, which allowed
        to implement some new

        features that were not available before (``platform`` and ``cgroupns_mode``
        parameters).

          license for every file that is not automatically generated (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/430).

      bugfixes:
        - docker_image - when composing the build context, trim trailing whitespace

          6.0.0 will also include this change (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/434).
        - modules and plugins communicating directly with the Docker daemon - fix
          ``ProxyCommand`` handling for SSH connections when not using ``use_ssh_client=true``.
          This is only a change relative to older community.docker 3.0.0 pre-releases

        - modules and plugins communicating directly with the Docker daemon - fix

          strings anymore since 3.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/505,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/506).

        - current_container_facts - make work with current Docker version, also support
          Podman (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/510).
        - docker_image - when using ``archive_path``, detect whether changes are necessary
          based on the image ID (hash). If the existing tar archive matches the source,
          do nothing. Previously, each task execution re-created the archive (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/500).

      minor_changes:

          2.0.0. This is necessary until the vendored code from Docker SDK for Python
          has been fully adjusted to work with a feature of urllib3 that is used since

      known_issues:
        - docker_api connection plugin - does **not work with TCP TLS sockets**! This

        The collection now includes a bunch of new ``docker_image_*`` modules that

        and can better declare whether

        This version also features modules that support the Docker CLI plugins ``buildx``
        and ``compose``.

        The ``docker_image_build`` module uses the ``docker buildx`` command under

        module uses the ``docker compose`` command. Both these modules use the Docker
        CLI instead of directly talking

        to the API. The modules support mostly the same interface as the API based
        modules, so the main difference is that

        instead of some Python requirements, they depend on the Docker CLI tool ``docker``.

    changes:
      major_changes:
        - The ``community.docker`` collection now depends on the ``community.library_inventory_filtering_v1``
          collection. This utility collection provides host filtering functionality
          for inventory plugins. If you use the Ansible community package, both collections
          are included and you do not have to do anything special. If you install
          the collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install``, it will be installed
          automatically. If you install the collection by copying the files of the
          collection to a place where ansible-core can find it, for example by cloning
          the git repository, you need to make sure that you also have to install
          the dependency if you are using the inventory plugins (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/698).
      minor_changes:
        - The ``ca_cert`` option available to almost all modules and plugins has been
          renamed to ``ca_path``. The name ``ca_path`` is also used for similar options
          in ansible-core and other collections. The old name has been added as an
          alias and can still be used (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/744).
        - The ``docker_stack*`` modules now use the common CLI-based module code added
          for the ``docker_image_build`` and ``docker_compose_v2`` modules. This means
          that the modules now have various more configuration options with respect
          to talking to the Docker Daemon, and now also are part of the ``community.docker.docker``
          and ``docker`` module default groups (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/745).
        - inventory plugins - add ``filter`` option which allows to include and exclude
          hosts based on Jinja2 conditions (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/698,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/610).

        This version also features modules that support the Docker CLI plugins ``buildx``
        and ``compose``.

        The ``docker_image_build`` module uses the ``docker buildx`` command under
        the hood, and the ``docker_compose_v2``

        and ``docker_compose_v2_pull`` modules uses the ``docker compose`` command.
        All these modules use the Docker CLI

        instead of directly talking to the API. The modules support mostly the same
        interface as the API based modules,

        so the main difference is that instead of some Python requirements, they depend
        on the Docker CLI tool ``docker``.


        Changes since the last beta:

        * The ``docker_compose_v2*`` modules also checks for ``compose.yaml`` and
        ``compose.yml``, not only for ``docker-compose.yaml`` and ``docker-compose.yml``.

        * You can now specify ``services`` in the ``docker_compose_v2`` module.

        * You can now specify ``build`` in the ``docker_compose_v2`` module (allows
        to pass ``--build`` or ``--no-build`` depending on its value).

  3.6.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - docker_image - fix archiving idempotency with Docker API 1.44 or later (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/765).
      minor_changes:
        - docker_container - add ``networks[].mac_address`` option for Docker API
          1.44+. Note that Docker API 1.44 no longer uses the global ``mac_address``
          option, this new option is the only way to set the MAC address for a container
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/763).
      release_summary: 'Bugfix and feature release.


        The collection now includes a bunch of new ``docker_image_*`` modules that
        move features out of the

        rather complex ``docker_image`` module. These new modules are easier to use
        and can better declare whether

        they support check mode, diff mode, or none of them.


        This version also features modules that support the Docker CLI plugins ``buildx``
        and ``compose``.

        The ``docker_image_build`` module uses the ``docker buildx`` command under
        the hood, and the ``docker_compose_v2``

        and ``docker_compose_v2_pull`` modules uses the ``docker compose`` command.
        All these modules use the Docker CLI

        instead of directly talking to the API. The modules support mostly the same
        interface as the API based modules,

        so the main difference is that instead of some Python requirements, they depend

    changes:

        - docker_compose_v2 - do not consider a ``Waiting`` event as an action/change
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/804).
        - docker_compose_v2 - do not treat service-level pull events as changes to
          avoid incorrect ``changed=true`` return value of ``pull=always`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/802,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/803).
        - docker_compose_v2, docker_compose_v2_pull - fix parsing of pull messages
          for Docker Compose 2.20.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/785,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/786).
      minor_changes:
        - docker_compose_v2 - allow to wait until containers are running/health when
          running ``docker compose up`` with the new ``wait`` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/794,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/796).
        - docker_container - the ``pull_check_mode_behavior`` option now allows to
          control the module's behavior in check mode when ``pull=always`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/792,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/797).
        - docker_container - the ``pull`` option now accepts the three values ``never``,
          ``missing_image`` (default), and ``never``, next to the previously valid
          values ``true`` (equivalent to ``always``) and ``false`` (equivalent to
          ``missing_image``). This allows the equivalent to ``--pull=never`` from

  3.8.1:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - docker_compose_v2 - do not fail when non-fatal errors occur. This can happen
          when pulling an image fails, but then the image can be built for another
          service. Docker Compose emits an error in that case, but ``docker compose
          up`` still completes successfully (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/807,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/810, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/811).
        - docker_compose_v2* modules - correctly parse ``Warning`` events emitted
          by Docker Compose (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/807,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/811).
        - docker_compose_v2* modules - parse ``logfmt`` warnings emitted by Docker
          Compose (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/787,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/811).
        - docker_compose_v2_pull - fixing idempotence by checking actual pull progress
          events instead of service-level pull request when ``policy=always``. This
          stops the module from reporting ``changed=true`` if no actual change happened
          when pulling. In check mode, it has to assume that a change happens though
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/813, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/814).

          as templates is not possible (https://www.die-welt.net/2024/03/remote-code-execution-in-ansible-dynamic-inventory-plugins/,

  3.9.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - docker_compose_v2* - allow ``project_src`` to be a relative path, by converting
          it to an absolute path before using it (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/827,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/828).
        - docker_compose_v2* modules - abort with a nice error message instead of
          crash when the Docker Compose CLI plugin version is ``dev`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/825,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/826).
        - inventory plugins - add unsafe wrapper to avoid marking strings that do
          not contain ``{`` or ``}`` as unsafe, to work around a bug in AWX (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/835).
      minor_changes:
        - The EE requirements now include PyYAML, since the ``docker_compose_v2*``
          modules depend on it when the ``definition`` option is used. This should
          not have a noticable effect on generated EEs since ansible-core itself depends
          on PyYAML as well, and ansible-builder explicitly ignores this dependency
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/832).
        - docker_compose_v2* - the new option ``check_files_existing`` allows to disable
          the check for one of the files ``compose.yaml``, ``compose.yml``, ``docker-compose.yaml``,
          and ``docker-compose.yml`` in ``project_src`` if ``files`` is not specified.
          This is necessary if a non-standard compose filename is specified through
          other means, like the ``COMPOSE_FILE`` environment variable (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/838,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/839).
        - docker_compose_v2* modules - allow to provide an inline definition of the
          compose content instead of having to provide a ``project_src`` directory
          with the compose file written into it (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/829,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/832).
        - vendored Docker SDK for Python - remove unused code that relies on functionality

  3.10.0:
    changes:
      deprecated_features:
        - docker_compose - the Docker Compose v1 module is deprecated and will be
          removed from community.docker 4.0.0. Please migrate to the ``community.docker.docker_compose_v2``
          module, which works with Docker Compose v2 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/823,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/833).
        - various modules and plugins - the ``ssl_version`` option has been deprecated
          and will be removed from community.docker 4.0.0. It has already been removed
          from Docker SDK for Python 7.0.0, and was only necessary in the past to
          work around SSL/TLS issues (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/853).
      minor_changes:
        - docker_container - adds ``healthcheck.start_interval`` to support healthcheck
          start interval setting on containers (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/848).
        - docker_container - adds ``healthcheck.test_cli_compatible`` to allow omit
          test option on containers without remove existing image test (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/847).
        - docker_image_build - add ``outputs`` option to allow configuring outputs
          for the build (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/852).
        - docker_image_build - add ``secrets`` option to allow passing secrets to
          the build (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/852).
        - docker_image_build - allow ``platform`` to be a list of platforms instead
          of only a single platform for multi-platform builds (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/852).
        - docker_network - adds ``config_only`` and ``config_from`` to support creating
          and using config only networks (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/395).
        - docker_prune - add new options ``builder_cache_all``, ``builder_cache_filters``,
          and ``builder_cache_keep_storage``, and a new return value ``builder_cache_caches_deleted``
          for pruning build caches (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/844,

          no longer leads to an invalid parameter combination being passed to the
          corresponding Docker CLI tool, unless ``docker_host`` is also provided.
          Combining ``cli_context`` and ``docker_host`` is no longer allowed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/892,

        - docker_compose_v2 - make sure that services provided in ``services`` are
          appended to the command line after ``--`` and not before it (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/942).
        - docker_compose_v2* modules, docker_image_build - provide better error message
          when required fields are not present in ``docker version`` or ``docker info``
          output. This can happen if Podman is used instead of Docker (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/891,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/935).
        - docker_container - fix idempotency if ``network_mode=default`` and Docker
          26.1.0 or later is used. There was a breaking change in Docker 26.1.0 regarding
          normalization of ``NetworkMode`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/934,

        - docker_container - when specifying a MAC address for a container's network,
          and the network is attached after container creation (for example, due to
          idempotency checks), the MAC address is at least in some cases ignored by
          the Docker Daemon (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/933).
      minor_changes:
        - docker, docker_api connection plugins - allow to determine the working directory
          when executing commands with the new ``working_dir`` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/943).
        - docker, docker_api connection plugins - allow to execute commands with extended
          privileges with the new ``privileges`` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/943).
        - docker, docker_api connection plugins - allow to pass extra environment
          variables when executing commands with the new ``extra_env`` option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/937,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/940).
        - docker_compose_v2* modules - support Docker Compose 2.29.0's ``json`` progress
          writer to avoid having to parse text output (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/931).
        - docker_compose_v2_pull - add new options ``ignore_buildable``, ``include_deps``,
          and ``services`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/941,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/942).
        - docker_container - when creating a container, directly pass all networks
          to connect to to the Docker Daemon for API version 1.44 and newer. This
          makes creation more efficient and works around a bug in Docker Daemon that
          does not use the specified MAC address in at least some cases, though only
          for creation (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/933).

  4.2.0:
    changes:
      bugfixes:
        - docker_compose_v2 - when using Compose 2.31.0 or newer, revert to the old
          behavior that image rebuilds, for example if ``rebuild=always``, only result
          in ``changed`` if a container has been restarted (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/1005,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/pull/1011).
        - docker_image_build - work around bug resp. very unexpected behavior in Docker
          buildx that overwrites all image names in ``--output`` parameters if ``--tag``
          is provided, which the module did by default in the past. The module now
          only supplies ``--tag`` if ``outputs`` is empty. If ``outputs`` has entries,
          it will add an additional entry with ``type=image`` if no entry of ``type=image``
          contains the image name specified by the ``name`` and ``tag`` options (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/1001,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/1006).
        - docker_network - added waiting while container actually disconnect from
          Swarm network (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/999).
        - docker_network - containers are only reconnected to a network if they really
          exist (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/999).
        - docker_network - enabled "force" option in Docker network container disconnect
          API call (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/999).
        - docker_swarm_info - do not crash when finding Swarm jobs if ``services=true``
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/1003).
      minor_changes:
        - docker_compose_v2 - add ``ignore_build_events`` option (default value ``true``)
          which allows to (not) ignore build events for change detection (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/1005,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/pull/1011).
        - docker_image_build - ``outputs[].name`` can now be a list of strings (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/1006).
        - docker_image_build - the executed command is now returned in the ``command``
          return value in case of success and some errors (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/1006).

          step because they are already validated by the parameter definition (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/1034).
        - vendored Docker SDK for Python - do not assume that ``KeyError`` is always
          for ``ApiVersion`` when querying version fails (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/1033,

          data (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/1152).
        - docker_container_exec - make ``detach=true`` work. So far this resulted
          in no execution being done (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/1145).
        - docker_plugin - fix diff mode for plugin options (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/1146).
      minor_changes:
        - docker_container - add ``driver_opts`` option in ``networks`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/1142,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/1143).
        - docker_container - add ``gw_priority`` option in ``networks`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/issues/1142,
          https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/1143).
      release_summary: 'First alpha release of community.docker 5.0.0.


        The main changes are that the collection dropped support for some ansible-core
        versions that are End of Life, and thus dropped support for Python 2.7.

        This allowed to modernize the Python code, in particular with type hints.

        Also all module and plugin utils are now private to the collection, which
        makes it easier to refactor code.

        All these changes should have no effect on end-users.


        The current plan is to release 5.0.0 in time for Ansible 13''s feature freeze,
        so in roughly one week.'
      removed_features:
        - Remove support for Docker SDK for Python version 1.x.y, also known as ``docker-py``.
          Modules and plugins that use Docker SDK for Python require version 2.0.0+
          (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/1171).
        - The collection no longer supports Python 3.6 and before. Note that this
          coincides with the Python requirements of ansible-core 2.17+ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/1123).
        - The collection no longer supports ansible-core 2.15 and 2.16. You need ansible-core
          2.17.0 or newer to use community.docker 5.x.y (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/1123).
