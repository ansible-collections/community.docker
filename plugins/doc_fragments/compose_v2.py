    The Docker compose CLI plugin has no stable output format (see for example U(https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/10872)),
    and for the main operations also no machine friendly output format. The module tries to accomodate this with various
    version-dependent behavior adjustments and with testing older and newer versions of the Docker compose CLI plugin.

    Currently the module is tested with multiple plugin versions between 2.18.1 and 2.23.3. The exact list of plugin versions
    will change over time. New releases of the Docker compose CLI plugin can break this module at any time.
