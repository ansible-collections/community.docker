module: docker_container_copy_into

short_description: Copy a file into a Docker container

version_added: 3.4.0

description:
  - Copy a file into a Docker container.
  - Similar to C(docker cp).
  - To copy files in a non-running container, you must provide the I(owner_id) and I(group_id) options.
    This is also necessary if the container does not contain a C(/bin/sh) shell with an C(id) tool.

attributes:
  check_mode:
    support: full
  diff_mode:
    support: full
    details:
      - Additional data will need to be transferred to compute diffs.
      - The module uses R(the MAX_FILE_SIZE_FOR_DIFF ansible-core configuration,MAX_FILE_SIZE_FOR_DIFF)
        to determine for how large files diffs should be computed.

options:
  container:
    description:
      - The name of the container to copy files to.
    type: str
    required: true
  path:
    description:
      - Path to a file on the managed node.
      - Mutually exclusive with I(content). One of I(content) and I(path) is required.
    type: path
  content:
    description:
      - The file's content.
      - If you plan to provide binary data, provide it pre-encoded to base64, and set I(content_is_b64=true).
      - Mutually exclusive with I(path). One of I(content) and I(path) is required.
    type: str
  content_is_b64:
    description:
      - If set to C(true), the content in I(content) is assumed to be Base64 encoded and
        will be decoded before being used.
      - To use binary I(content), it is better to keep it Base64 encoded and let it
        be decoded by this option. Otherwise you risk the data to be interpreted as
        UTF-8 and corrupted.
    type: bool
    default: false
  container_path:
    description:
      - Path to a file inside the Docker container.
      - Must be an absolute path.
    type: str
    required: true
  follow:
    description:
      - This flag indicates that filesystem links in the Docker container, if they exist, should be followed.
    type: bool
    default: false
  local_follow:
    description:
      - This flag indicates that filesystem links in the source tree (where the module is executed), if they exist, should be followed.
    type: bool
    default: true
  owner_id:
    description:
      - The owner ID to use when writing the file to disk.
      - If provided, I(group_id) must also be provided.
      - If not provided, the module will try to determine the user and group ID for the current user in the container.
        This will only work if C(/bin/sh) is present in the container and the C(id) binary or shell builtin is available.
        Also the container must be running.
    type: int
  group_id:
    description:
      - The group ID to use when writing the file to disk.
      - If provided, I(owner_id) must also be provided.
      - If not provided, the module will try to determine the user and group ID for the current user in the container.
        This will only work if C(/bin/sh) is present in the container and the C(id) binary or shell builtin is available.
        Also the container must be running.
    type: int
  mode:
    description:
      - The file mode to use when writing the file to disk.
      - Will use the file's mode from the source system if this option is not provided.
    type: int
  force:
    description:
      - If set to C(true), force writing the file (without performing any idempotency checks).
      - If set to C(false), only write the file if it does not exist on the target. If a filesystem object exists at
        the destination, the module will not do any change.
      - If this option is not specified, the module will be idempotent. To verify idempotency, it will try to get information
        on the filesystem object in the container, and if everything seems to match will download the file from the container
        to compare it to the file to upload.
