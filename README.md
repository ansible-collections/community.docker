# collection_template
You can build a new repository for an Ansible Collection using this template by following [Creating a repository from a template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). This README.md contains recommended headings for your collection README.md, with comments describing what each section should contain. Once you have created your collection repository, delete this paragraph and the title above it from your README.md.

# Foo Collection

## Tested with Ansible

<!-- List the versions of Ansible the collection has been tested with. Must match what is in galaxy.yml. -->

## External requirements

### Supported connections
<!-- Optional. If your collection supports only specific connection types (such as HTTPAPI, netconf, or others), list them here. -->
