# Docker Community Collection

[![Doc](https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-brightgreen.svg)](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/docker/)
[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/ansible/community.docker/_apis/build/status/CI?branchName=main)](https://dev.azure.com/ansible/community.docker/_build?definitionId=25)
[![Codecov](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/ansible-collections/community.docker)](https://codecov.io/gh/ansible-collections/community.docker)

This repo contains the `community.docker` Ansible Collection. The collection includes many modules and plugins to work with Docker.

Please note that this collection does **not** support Windows targets. The connection plugins included in this collection support Windows targets on a best-effort basis, but we are not testing this in CI.

## Tested with Ansible

Tested with the current ansible-core 2.11, ansible-core 2.12, ansible-core 2.13, ansible-core 2.14, ansible-core 2.15, and ansible-core 2.16 releases, and the current development version of ansible-core. Ansible/ansible-base versions before 2.11.0 are not supported.

Please note that Ansible 2.9 and ansible-base 2.10 are no longer supported. If you need to use them, use community.docker 2.x.y. Also note that this collection does not work with ansible-core 2.11 (this includes ansible-base and Ansible 2.9) on Python 3.12+.

## External requirements

Some modules and plugins require Docker CLI, or other external, programs. Some require the [Docker SDK for Python](https://pypi.org/project/docker/) and some use [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) to directly communicate with the Docker daemon API. All modules and plugins require Python 2.7 or later. Python 2.6 is no longer supported; use community.docker 2.x.y if you need to use Python 2.6.

Installing the Docker SDK for Python also installs the requirements for the modules and plugins that use `requests`. If you want to directly install the Python libraries instead of the SDK, you need the following ones:

- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/);
- [pywin32](https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/) when using named pipes on Windows with the Windows 32 API;
- [paramiko](https://pypi.org/project/paramiko/) when using SSH to connect to the Docker daemon with `use_ssh_client=false`;
- [pyOpenSSL](https://pypi.org/project/pyOpenSSL/) when using TLS to connect to the Docker daemon;
- [backports.ssl_match_hostname](https://pypi.org/project/backports.ssl_match_hostname/) when using TLS to connect to the Docker daemon on Python 2.

If you have Docker SDK for Python < 2.0.0 installed ([docker-py](https://pypi.org/project/docker-py/)), you can still use it for modules that support it, though we recommend to uninstall it and then install [docker](https://pypi.org/project/docker/), the Docker SDK for Python >= 2.0.0. Note that both libraries cannot be installed at the same time. If you accidentally did install them simultaneously, you have to uninstall *both* before re-installing one of them.

## Collection Documentation

Browsing the [**latest** collection documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/docker) will show docs for the _latest version released in the Ansible package_, not the latest version of the collection released on Galaxy.

Browsing the [**devel** collection documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/collections/community/docker) shows docs for the _latest version released on Galaxy_.

We also separately publish [**latest commit** collection documentation](https://ansible-collections.github.io/community.docker/branch/main/) which shows docs for the _latest commit in the `main` branch_.

If you use the Ansible package and do not update collections independently, use **latest**. If you install or update this collection directly from Galaxy, use **devel**. If you are looking to contribute, use **latest commit**.

## Using this collection

Before using the Docker community collection, you need to install the collection with the `ansible-galaxy` CLI:

    ansible-galaxy collection install community.docker

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it via `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml` using the format:

```yaml
collections:
- name: community.docker
```

See [Ansible Using collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.

## Contributing to this collection

If you want to develop new content for this collection or improve what is already here, the easiest way to work on the collection is to clone it into one of the configured [`COLLECTIONS_PATH`](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/config.html#collections-paths), and work on it there.

You can find more information in the [developer guide for collections](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_collections.html#contributing-to-collections), and in the [Ansible Community Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/index.html).

## Release notes

See the [changelog](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/tree/main/CHANGELOG.rst).
